  title: Voice API BETA
  description: |
    This is the *beta* version of the Voice API. Calls created with v2 must be managed
    using [v1 endpoints](/api/voice).

    Voice v2 is provided to allow users to create IP calls. If you do not have this requirement
    we recommend that you stay on v1 for now.

    > This API may break backwards compatibility at short notice (60 days)
